# Safe Memory Library

an ambitious project to make C a safer languages.
as for now, this project is at the beginning, and the main idea behind it is t write wrappers around
malloc()
calloc()
realloc()
and free()

mainly, becuase as for now i do not have the knowledge to re-write malloc() itself to make it safer.
